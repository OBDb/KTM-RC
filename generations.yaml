    description: "The first generation KTM RC series introduced the Austrian manufacturer's fully-faired sport bike lineup, sharing mechanical components with the naked Duke series but wrapped in aerodynamic bodywork with distinctive split LED headlights and aggressive styling. The RC lineup typically included the RC 125, RC 200, RC 250, and RC 390 models, varying by displacement and market availability. All featured KTM's characteristic steel trellis frame, WP suspension components, and high-performance Brembo braking systems (ByBre on smaller models). The ergonomics favored a committed sport riding position with clip-on handlebars positioned below the triple clamp, rearset footpegs, and a seat designed to lock the rider in place during aggressive cornering. Despite their sport-focused design, the RC models maintained relatively comfortable ergonomics for their class. The flagship RC 390 featured a 373.2cc single-cylinder engine producing around 43 horsepower, making it one of the most powerful bikes in the small-displacement sport bike segment. Throughout this generation, the RC series received incremental updates including improved cooling, ride-by-wire throttle, slipper clutch, and updated emissions equipment to meet evolving regulations, but the fundamental design remained consistent."

    description: "The second generation KTM RC series featured a comprehensive redesign with all-new bodywork, updated ergonomics, and technological improvements. The most noticeable change was the shift from the split headlight design to a single LED headlight housed in a larger, more aerodynamic front fairing inspired by KTM's RC16 MotoGP race bike. The new generation was designed to be more practical and accessible while maintaining the sporty character, with a more relaxed riding position, larger fuel tank, increased seat padding, and improved wind protection. Technical updates included a new LCD dashboard (with TFT display on premium models), adjustable lever positions, and increased service intervals. The chassis was revised with a new frame designed to offer better flex characteristics, lighter wheels that reduced unsprung weight, and updated suspension tuning for improved handling and ride quality. The RC 390 continued as the flagship model with features like cornering ABS, traction control, quickshifter, and multiple riding modes. Engine performance remained similar to the previous generation but with improved throttle response and refinement. The new generation represented KTM's effort to broaden the appeal of their sport bikes beyond track enthusiasts to include everyday riders, with improved comfort and practical features while maintaining the brand's focus on performance and handling."
